### Recommended Architecture Changes
```python
# Current: Tight Coupling
class Topic:
    def create():
        supabase.table('topics').insert()  # Direct DB access

# Recommended: Repository Pattern
class TopicRepository:
    def create(self, topic: Topic):
        return self.db.insert(topic)

class TopicService:
    def __init__(self, repo: TopicRepository):
        self.repo = repo
