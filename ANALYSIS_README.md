## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Where do I start?**  
A: Fix security issues (1 week), implement quick wins (1 week), then build classroom management (4 weeks).

**Q: How long until we can launch to schools?**  
A: 3 months for Phase 1 (minimum viable for schools).

**Q: What's the most critical missing feature?**  
A: Classroom management. Schools cannot use the platform without it.

**Q: Is the current platform secure enough for production?**  
A: No. Critical security vulnerabilities must be fixed immediately.

**Q: Do we need all these features to launch?**  
A: No. Phase 1 is sufficient for school pilots. Phase 2-3 are for competitive advantage.

**Q: What's the expected ROI?**  
A: 455-805% over 12 months if roadmap is executed.

**Q: Can we skip GDPR compliance?**  
A: Absolutely not. It's a legal requirement for UK/EU schools.

**Q: Should we build mobile apps?**  
A: Not yet. Build offline PWA first (much faster, works everywhere).

**Q: How do we validate these recommendations?**  
A: Talk to 20 teachers, run 3 pilot schools, track metrics.

**Q: What if we can't afford the full roadmap?**  
A: Focus on Phase 1 only (£15-25K). It makes the platform viable for schools.
