# My Learning Companion Database Setup

## What This Is
I built this database setup for my AI-Powered Personal Learning Companion app. It's designed to help me track my learning progress, manage different topics I'm studying, and get AI-powered insights about my study habits.

## What I Created

### My Database Tables
1. **users** - Where I store user accounts (using Supabase's built-in auth)
2. **topics** - All the subjects and topics I want to learn
3. **study_sessions** - Every time I sit down to study, I track it here
4. **user_analytics** - AI analyzes my data and gives me recommendations

### Cool Features I Added
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) - keeps everyone's data private
- ✅ Automatic user_id population - no manual work needed
- ✅ Performance-optimized indexes - makes queries super fast
- ✅ Data integrity constraints - prevents bad data from getting in
- ✅ AI algorithm support functions - powers the smart recommendations
- ✅ Sample data - so I can test everything works

## How I Set This Up

### 1. Create My Supabase Project
1. I went to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Created a new project for my learning app
3. Saved my project URL and anon key (you'll need these!)

### 2. Run My Migration Files
I created these SQL files in order - run them one by one:
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor or via CLI
001_create_users_table.sql
002_create_topics_table.sql
003_create_study_sessions_table.sql
004_create_user_analytics_table.sql
005_additional_indexes_and_optimizations.sql
006_sample_data.sql
```

### 3. Set Up Authentication
1. Go to Authentication > Settings in your Supabase Dashboard
2. Enable email/password authentication
3. Configure email templates if you want custom emails

### 4. Add My Environment Variables
I added these to my Flask app's `.env` file:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## How My Data Connects

```
users (1) ──→ topics (many)
  │                │
  │                └──→ study_sessions (many)
  │
  └──→ user_analytics (many)
```

## AI Features I Built

I added these smart functions to make my app really intelligent:
- **Spaced Repetition**: `calculate_next_review_date()` - tells me when to review topics
- **Streak Tracking**: `calculate_streak()` - keeps track of my study streaks
- **Progress Analytics**: Automatic analytics updates via triggers - no manual work!

## Security Stuff I Implemented

- Row Level Security - makes sure users only see their own data
- Automatic user_id population - prevents accidental data leaks
- Input validation through CHECK constraints - stops bad data from getting in
- Secure password hashing via Supabase Auth - passwords are super safe

## Performance Tricks I Used

- Composite indexes for complex queries - makes searches lightning fast
- Partial indexes for active records - only indexes what I actually use
- Optimized views for dashboard analytics - dashboard loads instantly
- Efficient trigger-based analytics updates - analytics update automatically

## My Test Data

I created sample data to make sure everything works:
- 3 test users with different activity levels
- 6 topics across various difficulty levels  
- 10 study sessions with realistic progress data
- Complete analytics records for testing my AI features

## What I'm Working On Next

1. Run the migrations in my Supabase project
2. Update my Flask app configuration
3. Test the sample data to make sure it works
4. Implement the AI recommendation algorithms
5. Build the frontend dashboard

## Why I Built This

I wanted to create a learning companion that actually understands my study patterns and helps me learn more effectively. This database is the foundation that makes all the AI-powered features possible. It tracks everything I need to know about my learning journey and gives me insights I never had before!
