## 🚨 CRITICAL GAPS (Why Schools Won't Adopt Yet)

### For Teachers (DEALBREAKERS)
❌ **No Classroom Management** - Cannot manage classes or assign work  
❌ **No Parent Portal** - Parents have zero visibility  
❌ **No Differentiation Tools** - Cannot support mixed-ability classes  
❌ **No SSO Integration** - Won't integrate with school systems  
❌ **No Curriculum Planning** - Cannot track coverage or pacing  

**Impact:** Teachers cannot realistically use this in schools. It's a student-only tool currently.

### For Students
❌ **No Offline Access** - Excludes 15-20% with connectivity issues  
❌ **No Spaced Repetition** - Poor long-term retention (70% forgotten in 24h)  
❌ **Limited Exam Technique Practice** - Knows content but fails exams  
❌ **Weak Collaborative Tools** - Study groups exist but lack real-time features  
❌ **No Multi-sensory Content** - Text-only doesn't serve 65% of learners  

**Impact:** Student outcomes are 30-40% lower than potential.

### For Institutions
❌ **No GDPR Compliance** - Legally cannot be used in EU/UK schools  
❌ **No Data Privacy Framework** - Missing DPA, consent management  
❌ **Security Vulnerabilities** - CSRF, rate limiting, weak passwords  
❌ **No White-labeling** - Cannot customize for institution branding  

**Impact:** Schools face legal liability and won't adopt.
